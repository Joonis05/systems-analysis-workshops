# Workshop #1

This project involves the analysis of randomly generated genetic sequences to detect specific motifs and filter sequences based on Shannon entropy. The key objectives are:

- **Motif Detection**: Searching for occurrences of a given motif within a large dataset of genetic sequences.
- **Entropy Filtering**: Using Shannon entropy to measure sequence complexity and filter out low-entropy (predictable) sequences.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measuring the time taken to find the first occurrence of the motif and the total time for the search, both before and after filtering.

### Key Features
- Multi-threaded generation of random genetic sequences.
- Motif search with performance metrics (time in seconds).
- Entropy-based filtering to focus on more complex sequences.

### Technologies
- **Language**: Java
- **Metrics**: Shannon entropy for complexity analysis
